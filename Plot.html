			<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, the Japanese national team finished 16th in the FIFA World Cup.
			As a result, the Japan Football Association hires the football enigma Ego Jinpachi.
			His master plan to lead Japan to stardom is Blue Lock, a training regimen designed to 
			create the world's greatest egotist striker.
			Those who fail Blue Lock will never again be permitted to represent any Japanese team.
			Yoichi Isagi, an unknown high school football player who is conflicted about his playing style,
			decides to join the program in order to become the best egotistical striker in the world.</p>
			<p>
			Blue Lock is set in the wake of the latest World Cup tournament,
			wherein Japan suffered a debilitating defeat, both on the field and toward its national pride.
			Seeking to change its fortunes, the Japanese Soccer Union enacts a training experiment titled Blue Lock.
			Headed by mysterious soccer savant Ego Jinpachi, the goal of the program is to bring together a group of players and find the
			world's greatest "ego striker," with this player thereafter leading Japan to victory against other soccer teams.
			Of course, this is no ordinary sports regimen, and the results could be disastrous for those who fail to make the cut.
			Losers will be disqualified from ever having any role in Japanese professional soccer going forward.
			Ironically, the main character is Yoichi Isagi, a somewhat middling player whose goal is to somehow best his
			opponents and become the best soccer player in the world.</p>
			
			<p>
			Japan keeps losing the World Cup, over and over. After Isagi Yoichi,
			a forward for a high school team, gets eliminated in the last game in the qualifier for nationals,
			gets invited to a program called "Blue Lock" Their coach will be Ego Jinpachi,
			who intends to "destroy Japanese loser football" by introducing a radical new training regimen:
			isolate 300 young forwards in a prison-like institution called "Blue Lock" and put them through 
			rigorous training aimed at creating "the world's greatest egotist striker."</p>
