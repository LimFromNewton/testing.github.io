			is a second-year high school student, who previously played as a forward for the Ichinan High School
			football team. When he arrived at the Blue Lock facility, he became a member of Team Z for the First
			Selection. His main goal is to become the world‚Äôs ""best striker"".

			<p>Bachira is a whimsical forward who plays following his instincts and when first
			arriving at Blue Lock he was a member of Team Z during First Selection.

			<p>Chigiri is a forward prodigy who was chained down by a leg injury in his past but he
			let go of his fears while at Blue Lock so he could continue playing football wholeheartedly.
			When first arriving at Blue Lock, Chigiri was member of Team Z. Chigiri spent half of the First
			Selection avoiding participation or keeping it to a bare minimum but when he was motivated by Isagi
			in Team Z's third game, he decided to let go of his fear and play football to become the world's best
			striker like his rivals.<a href="https://bluelock.fandom.com/wiki/Hyoma_Chigiri"> More Info... </a></p>
